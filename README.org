* Emacs Configuration
  This repository contains all of the configuration and customization I've done to tailor Emacs to my needs.
  It is published here for both my benefit, and in the hopes that others might look and take inspiration
  from my work.
** Literate Configuration
   My Emacs configuration is almost wholly contained within the [[file:Eearslya.org][Eearslya.org]] file.
   There, the file can be organized into logical sections, and extra documentation and explanation can be added.
   The [[file:init.el][init.el]] file contains several methods that will extract the ELisp from [[file:Eearslya.org][Eearslya.org]] and combine it all
   together into the file *Eearslya.el*, which is then loaded into Emacs to apply the configuration.
